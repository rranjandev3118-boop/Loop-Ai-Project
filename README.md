# LOOP — AI Customer-Feedback Intelligence Platform

A corporate-grade internship implementation of Project LOOP.

## Project LOOP

LOOP is a multi-tenant customer-feedback intelligence platform. Teams can
ingest support tickets, app reviews, survey responses, sales notes, and
community posts, then classify, search, cluster, and summarize the feedback
with Claude.

## Acceptance-criteria coverage

### C1 Authentication & workspaces
- Sign-up creates a workspace and ADMIN user.
- Passwords are bcrypt-hashed.
- Auth.js sessions persist.
- Protected app routes require an authenticated session.
- Tenant-owned queries use `workspaceId`.

### C2 RBAC
- ADMIN, ANALYST and VIEWER roles.
- Server-side role guards return 403 for forbidden API operations.
- Admin workspace member view is included.
- Analysts are the intended ingestion/triage role; viewers are read-only.

### C3 Feedback ingestion
- Validated single-entry API.
- Schema supports CSV fields: content, channel, customerLabel, createdAt.
- Seeded simulated channels represent Support ticket, App store, NPS survey, Sales call note and Community post.
- Feedback is classified on ingestion through the dedicated `lib/ai/` module.
- CSV imports accept `content`, `channel`, `customerLabel`, and optional
  `createdAt` columns (maximum 1,000 rows / 5 MB).
- Analysts and admins can generate simulated support tickets from the inbox.

### C4 Feedback inbox
- Inbox is workspace-scoped.
- Server-side offset pagination supports search, channel, sentiment, theme, and status filters.
- Status model: NEW → REVIEWED → ACTIONED.
- Theme/sentiment/channel data is persisted for filtering.

### C5 Analytics
- Dashboard stat cards: total items, % negative, new this week.
- Theme counts are computed from real database relations.
- Dashboard charts use Recharts for volume-over-time, sentiment breakdown, and top-theme charts.

### AI1 Auto-classification
- Feedback model stores sentiment, sentiment score, themes, feature area and rationale.
- Claude prompts and response parsing are centralized in `lib/ai/`; responses are Zod-validated.
- Manual re-classification endpoint can be added using the same service boundary.

### AI2 Theme clustering & trends
- Theme + FeedbackTheme models support named themes, confidence and drill-down.
- Trends page shows real theme volumes; period-over-period spike calculation can be added to the same query service.

### AI3 Ask LOOP
- `/api/insights/ask` retrieves workspace feedback before generating an answer.
- Workspace-scoped retrieval runs before Claude; Claude is instructed to answer only from retrieved context and cite item numbers.
- If no Claude key exists, demo grounding mode exposes the actual retrieved records rather than inventing content.

### AI4 VoC report
- Report model persists period, author and JSON report content.
- Seed includes a saved example report.
- Weekly and monthly reports precompute statistics and use Claude for a grounded narrative when an API key is configured.

## Stack
Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Auth.js,
Claude API, Recharts, Papa Parse, and Zod.

## Local setup
1. Node.js 18+ and PostgreSQL.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Set `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and `NEXTAUTH_URL`. Configure the
   `SMTP_*` variables in `.env.example` for OTP and invitation delivery.
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` are optional. Never commit `.env`
   files.
4. Run:
   - `npm install` (this automatically runs `prisma generate`)
   - `npx prisma generate` (also run this after changing `prisma/schema.prisma`)
   - `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
   - `npm run seed`
   - `npm run dev`

New workspace signups verify the email address with a single-use, 10-minute
email OTP before the workspace and admin account are created. Invited members
use the same verification step and receive their role from the stored
invitation; roles are never accepted from the browser.

Login OTPs are required for non-demo users after password verification. OTPs
expire after 10 minutes, allow five attempts, enforce a 60-second resend
cooldown, and allow at most five sends per hour per email. Without SMTP
settings, development logs a clearly labeled OTP to the server terminal;
production requires configured SMTP and sends no OTP when it is unavailable.

Set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, and `SMTP_SECURE` using the values supplied by
your email provider. Set `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASS` when the provider requires
authentication. `SMTP_FROM` is optional when `SMTP_USER` is set. For Gmail,
enable 2-Step Verification, create a Google App Password, and use your Gmail
address for `SMTP_USER` and the App Password for `SMTP_PASS` (not your normal
account password). Workspace invitations are delivered to the
address entered by the administrator and contain a single-use signup link that
expires after 7 days; the link is not copied to the clipboard or exposed in
the browser response.

### CSV format

```csv
content,channel,customerLabel,createdAt
"Onboarding invitations arrive late","Support ticket","Acme","2026-09-18T09:00:00.000Z"
```

### Verification

- `npm test` runs the lightweight Node test runner through `tsx`, covering
  validation, API payload contracts, tenant scoping, RBAC, CSV import limits,
  and AI fallback/grounding behavior.
- `npm run verify:tenant-isolation` creates two temporary workspaces, checks a
  tenant-scoped query, and removes only its own test records.
- `npm run build` runs Prisma generation, TypeScript validation, and the
  production Next.js build.
- `npm test` runs the unit/API contract, RBAC, tenant-scope, CSV, and AI
  grounding tests.
- `GET /api/health` verifies the application/database readiness.

## Deployment

Deploy the repository as a Next.js project on Vercel. Set the same environment
variables from `.env.example` in the Vercel project settings, including
`CRON_SECRET`, use the default build command (`npm run build`), and run
`npx prisma migrate deploy` followed by `npm run seed` once against the
production database before sharing demo credentials. `vercel.json` schedules a
protected job endpoint every minute to retry queued AI classification work.
Report PDF exports are generated server-side and are returned with private,
non-cacheable download headers; configure private object storage before
retaining exported files beyond the request.

## If you see “@prisma/client did not initialize yet”

Stop the dev server, then run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

The project runs `prisma generate` automatically after `npm install` and before `build`. It is intentionally not run automatically before `dev`, because Windows can lock the Prisma query-engine DLL while a previous Next.js process is still running. If the Prisma client is out of date, stop the dev server, run `npx prisma generate`, and restart `npm run dev`.

## Demo credentials
All three seeded accounts use password `LoopDemo123!`:
- Admin: admin@loop.demo
- Analyst: analyst@loop.demo
- Viewer: viewer@loop.demo

Demo accounts are pre-verified and do not require OTP.

Do not reuse the demo password elsewhere.

## Security
Never commit `.env`, API keys, database credentials, or `node_modules`. All tenant data must be queried with the authenticated user's workspace ID.
